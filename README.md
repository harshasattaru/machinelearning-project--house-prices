# machinelearning-project--house-prices
this project is all about predicting house prices using linear regression models
this project is all based on a competion on kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview
all the datasets are from kaggle there are 80 variables of which house prioce is the dependent variable we hav to predict the rest are attributes to houses which affects the price
